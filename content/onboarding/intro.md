## [General Principles]()

Cyclic Support Group (CSG) is a group of individuals which aims to hold each other up.
You can think of Cyclic as your primary support group.

It's a place where you can:

- Chat with people of different background and ideas.
- Share your work and ask for feedback.
- Request or offer any technical or logistical support.
- Declare your goals and ask for accountability.
- Access or contribute to the group's collaborative library.

Hence, we encourage our members to aspire the following:

- Do what you love every time you have an opportunity.
- Participate in standups and accountability calls at least once a month.
- Share progress to the group regularly.
- Help each other and grow together as a community.

- Be warm and friendly - Let us be our best selves here and be that positive influence to one another/
- Tropa tropa tayo dito ~~mga gago~~, dapat close friend vibe ang group natin, char.

Apart from being small, the group is relatively new. So please bear in mind that things might not be as smooth as it's supposed to be. Additionally, since we are at our early stages, feedback and suggestions are very much appreciated.

## [Cyclic Framework]()

CSG is a group that abides by the [Cyclic 2.0 Framework](/guidelines/cyclic-2).

In summary, the framework highlights the following points:

- Cyclic is a community framework which aims to provide its members an environment to build specific knowledge.
- Cyclic is open-source: it can be forked, edited, and modified.
- Groups who adopt Cyclic are termed to be Cyclic-compliant groups.
- There are six requirements a group should have to be Cyclic-compliant:
  1. Common Area
  2. Common Library
  3. Accountability Routine
  4. Activity States
  5. Code of Conduct
  6. Group Portfolio

To know the detailed scope and limitation of a Cyclic-compliant group, please read the [full Cyclic 2.0 specification here](/guidelines/cyclic-2).

## [Cyclic Support Group]()

The _Cyclic Support Group_ is the first implementation of a pure Cyclic-compliant group.

In summary, this implementation includes:

1. A Discord server as a common area.

   - Invitation links are sent privately and in CSG's official website.

2. A notion database as a common library.

   - It can be accessed through this link [https://www.notion.so/Cyclic-Resources-20d2a2b4116044589375f62fb31a7df9](https://www.notion.so/Cyclic-Resources-20d2a2b4116044589375f62fb31a7df9)
   - The link can also be found on `#quick-links` channel.
   - The collection currently contains tutorials, references, and tools about
     - Digital art
     - Design
     - Music
     - Web development
     - Motion graphics
     - Business ops
     - Productivity
     - Exclusive group-only resources
   - You can contribute to the library directly updating the notion pages or by sending them at `#misc-dump` channel.

3. Regular standups as the accountability routine.
   - The group hosts four kinds of standup sessions (Daily, Weekly, Monthly, Synchronous).
   - You are required to attend at least one of any kind every month.
4. The code of conduct presented below as the group's primary code of conduct.
5. A page on CSG's official website, [https://cyclic-group.netlify.app/gallery](https://cyclic-group.netlify.app/gallery), as its group portfolio.

Please read the [official CSG Implementation](/guidelines/main) for a more detailed implementation.

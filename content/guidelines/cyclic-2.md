## Rationale

### Open-source Community Structure

Cyclic (or the "Cyclic Guidelines") is a bit unique than a typical community guidelines or a code of coduct. For one, Cyclic embraces an open-source approach. This means that Cyclic is not bounded into only one specific group and welcomes a collaborative derivation of its guidelines. The guidelines can be adopted by any group. Also, groups are free to to edit, modify, or restructure a copy of the guidelines in any way to cater the specific needs of its members.

Hence, permision is granted, free of charge, to any group or subgroup adopting a copy of this guidelines and associated documentation files, to deal in the guidelines without restriction, including without limitation the rights to adopt, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell versions of the guidelines.

Any group that chooses to adopt the Cyclic framework or its derivative is termed to be a Cyclic-compliant group. Derivative frameworks based on cyclic is termed to be flavors of cyclic. And a group that adopts a non-derivative flavor of cyclic is termed as pure Cyclic-compliant group.

### A framework for specific knowledge

Cyclic, in its very essence, is a community template, standard, or framework that provides its members an environment where they are free to discover and cultivate their **specific knowledges**.

Grasping specific knowledge is challenging. For one, it is highly personal and circumstantial. Second, it can not be taught nor trained. If a certain knowledge can be taught or trained for, then it becomes replicable. Once it can be replicated, then it becomes general knowledge - not specific knowledge.

To use Naval Ravikant's own words:

> The first thing to notice about specific knowledge is that you can’t be trained for it… \[it’s\] found much more by pursuing your innate talents, your genuine curiosity, and your passion…Very often specific knowledge is at the edge of knowledge. It’s also stuff that’s just being figured out or is really hard to figure out... \[It\] tends to be technical and creative. It’s on the bleeding edge of technology, on the bleeding edge of art, on the bleeding edge of communication.

By definition, no course, resource, nor reference can teach a person their specific knowledge. And by extension, no group - not even a Cyclic-compliant group, can ever teach its members their specific knowledge.

Unlike typical organizations, Cyclic recognizes this limitation. Instead of asserting an arbitrary procedure which claims to build specific knowledge, cyclic instead aims to provide an **environment** - a ground zero; a place where members would have the liberty to express their creativity in any shape or form absent from any judgment of arbitrary institutional nor societal metrics or validations. In this case, cyclic members would have an unrestrictive safe space to cast their attempts in building and finding their own specific knowledge.

With that said, Cyclic should be closely similar to an incubator. A community that actively distributes its value across its members - a support group per se.

It is also important to note that the Cyclic guidelines (or any pure Cyclic-compliant group) is **not**/**can not be**/**should not be** an organization. A group having a specific unified purpose and direction (i.e. an organization) that provides a safe space for **every possible member** to discover and hone their specific knowledge is an obvious contradiction. There is a difference between a community and an organization - Cyclic is a community.

This also implies that pure Cyclic-compliant groups is fundamentally a non-partisan, non-profit and neutral entity operating across diverse sectoral subjects that guarantees the creative freedom of its members.

Also, this does **not** mean that pure Cyclic-compliant group members (or a subset thereof) can not engage in any partisan, for profit, nor stanced activities. This just means that participation of group members (a subset or even a complete set) does **not** imply the participation of the **group as a whole**.

### Mutual accountability

As established above, each member have the freedom to work on things that they want to. A Cyclic-compliant group's implementation and processes should not get in the way of each member's creative freedom. As such, having a centralized top-level process or procedure that can ensure the enforcement of such endeavors is a contradictory approach. Hence, Cyclic instead relies on mutual accountability between members.

### Activity States

The Cyclic guidelines recognizes that members of an adopting group also have other priorities and responsibilities outside of their membership duties. Hence, a Cyclic-compliant group should provide its members the capability to pause or resume their activity any time for any reason.

## Implementation

For a certain group to be deemed as Cyclic-compliant group, the group shall meet the following criterias consistent with Cyclic's rationale.

### 1. Common Area

The first requirement is to have a place for members to socialize, chat, and exchange ideas. This could be a literal physical space such as a dedicated room, hangout place, or any area that could serve the purpose. It could also be a virtual space such as a chat room, Slack, Facebook, or a Discord group. It could also be a combination of both.

### 2. Common Library

A Cyclic-compliant group should also provide its members a dedicated space to dump, store, and organize ideas, information, or references that could potentially help other members.

### 3. Accountability Routines

A Cyclic-compliant group should establish an accountability routine where members are free to participate. The adopting group has the freedom to choose the specific activity or the frequency required for each members to participate. Non-participation of a member from the said activities will make them an `inactive` member - see **4. Activity States** for more details.

### 4. Activity states

A cyclic-compliant group should establish activity states for each member. At the very least, a group should have 2 states - `active` or `inactive` (or any equivalent states). By default, a group member is an `active` member.

`active` members are expected to participate in the group's accountability routines. An `inactive` member is not required to join the accountability routines

Members are encouraged to change their activity state to `inactive` when they're going through a demanding activity outside of cyclic - this could be academics, personal priorities, etc. Members have the freedom to change their activity states any time for any reason.

### 5. Code of Conduct

A cyclic-compliant group should also adopt a code of conduct similar on the code of conduct attached on this document.

### 6. Group Portfolio

A cyclic-compliant group should also have a portfolio documentation. This portfolio should be publicly available and should showcase its members' progress. Note that the portfolio should only contain content in which its respective creator has given the consent for it to be published.

## Code of conduct

### The Code

Like the community as a whole, a Cyclic-compliant community is made up of a mixture of people, working on diverse aspects.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're participating within this community. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us, the community we hope to guide new members to.

_This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes Discord groups, Facbook groups, Chat forums etc._

- Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
- Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of a Cyclic-compliant community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside a Cyclic-compliant community.
- Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the community.

When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and a Cyclic-compliant group is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of Cyclic-compliant group comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.

### Commitee

A Cyclic-compliant group should establish a staff or commitee that is responsible for enforcing the above code of conduct. The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus.

Possible responses may include:

- Taking no further action (if the committee determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved.
- A public reprimand. In this case, a committee member will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in the same Discord channel for a Discord violation; in IRC for an IRC violation; email for an email violation, etc.). The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from the common area). A committee member will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Cyclic group spaces (Discord server, common library, etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new Cyclic group fora, or otherwise maintained.
- A request for a public or private apology. a committee member will deliver this request. The committee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, the committee may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her membership on the group.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the committee is not required to act on this feedback.

### Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest a committee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary. If a report concerns a possible violation by a current committee member, this member should be excluded from the response process. For these cases, anyone can make a report directly to any of the committee members.

## Adoption

To adopt the [Cyclic 2.0]() community framework, all you need to do is to add the following clauses in your group's guidelines.

1. Adoption Clause
2. Consistency Clause
3. Deviation Clause
4. Code of Conduct
5. Versions

### 1. Adoption Clause

The adoption clause officially declares that your group adopts the Cyclic framework.

- Include a statement that your group adopts the Cyclic community framework. Explicitly state its version.
- Include an encouragement to read the full guidelines with a hyperlink to this document.
- Include directions where to find the your group's cyclic implementation details.

### 2. Consistency Clause

The consistency clause enumerates the group implementation that is consistent with this document's rationale.

- For **Common Area**, state the implementation type (e.g. is it physical? fb group? discord group) and how new members could access it.
- For **Common Library**, state how this is implemented, how members could access it, and how members could contribute.
- For **Accountability Routine**, state the routine, who is required, what is the minimum requirement, and what will happen for non-participation.
- For **Activity States**, declare what will be the activity states and what will be expected for each states. Also, mention how members would transition to each states.
- For **Code of Conduct**, state which code of conduct will the group enforce. If you will not use the code of conduct attached to this page, you are required to include a copy of your code of conduct. State who will be responsible for enforcing the Code of Conduct.
- For **Group Portfolio**, include directions on how to access the group portfolio.

### 3. Deviation Clause

The deviation clause enumerates the group implementation that deviates from Cyclic community framework. If no deviations were made, write "No deviations".

### 4. Code of Conduct

This clause is optional for group's that adopted a Code of Conduct similar to the one in this document. However, it is required for groups with different Code of Conduct.

### 5. Versions

Include links of Cyclic versions relevant in your guidelines.

# Cyclic Support Group Guidelines

Starting on August 11, 2021, Cyclic Support Group (CSG) will fully adopt the [Cyclic 2.0](cyclic-2) guidelines. Members who haven't migrated to [Cyclic 2.0](cyclic-2) yet after [Cyclic 1.0](https://sites.google.com/view/cyclic-group/guidelines) deprecation date is at risk of losing their group access.

Cyclic Support Group (CSG) adopts the [Cyclic 2.0](cyclic-2) community framework with implementation details declared below. However, before continuing, please make sure to read and understand the full scope and definitions of [Cyclic 2.0 here]().

Consistent with [Cyclic 2.0](cyclic-2) rationale:

- CSG uses a Discord server as its [Common Area](). The invitation link for the server will be sent directly to newly-invited members and is also available via CSG's official website.

- CSG uses a Notion database as its [Common Library](). The URL for the database can be found in the server's `#quick-links` channel. Members can contribute to the library by editing in Notion directly or by sending resources at `#misc-dump` channel.
- CSG hosts regular standups on varying frequencies ( daily, weekly, monthly ) as its [Accountability Routine](). Additionally, synchronous standups may happen every two weeks depending on the number of available participants. Members have the freedom to choose which standup session they want to join. Members who are not in `vacation mode` are required to attend at least one standup session of any kind every month. Non-participation of a member from the standup sessions will put them in `vacation mode`.
- CSG declares two [Activity States]() for its members: (1) `non-vacation mode` as the active state, and (2) `vacation mode` as the inactive state. Members in `non-vacation mode` are required to participate in CSG's accountability routines. A member in `vacation mode` is not required to participate in such routines. Members are encouraged to enter `vacation mode` when they're going through a demanding activity outside of CSG - this could be academics, personal priorities, etc. Members have the freedom to change their activity states any time for any reason. This could be done by entering vacation mode in `#emergency-buttons` or by leaving vacation mode in `#disable-vacation-mode`.
- CSG follows the unmodified [Cyclic 2.0 Code of Conduct](), a copy is also available below. The members with role `@staff` is responsible for enforcing this **Code of Conduct**.
- CSG's [Group Portfolio]() can be found at CSG's official website.

## Code of conduct

### The Code

Like the community as a whole, a Cyclic-compliant community is made up of a mixture of people, working on diverse aspects.

Diversity is one of our huge strengths, but it can also lead to communication issues and unhappiness. To that end, we have a few ground rules that we ask people to adhere to when they're participating within this community. These rules apply equally to founders, mentors and those seeking help and guidance.

This isn't an exhaustive list of things that you can't do. Rather, take it in the spirit in which it's intended - a guide to make it easier to enrich all of us, the community we hope to guide new members to.

_This code of conduct applies to all communication: this includes Discord groups, Facbook groups, Chat forums etc._

- Be welcoming, friendly, and patient.
- Be considerate. Your work will be used by other people, and you in turn will depend on the work of others. Any decision you make will affect users and colleagues, and you should take those consequences into account when making decisions.
- Be respectful. Not all of us will agree all the time, but disagreement is no excuse for poor behaviour and poor manners. We might all experience some frustration now and then, but we cannot allow that frustration to turn into a personal attack. It's important to remember that a community where people feel uncomfortable or threatened is not a productive one. Members of a Cyclic-compliant community should be respectful when dealing with other members as well as with people outside a Cyclic-compliant community.
- Be careful in the words that you choose. Remember that sexist, racist, and other exclusionary jokes can be offensive to those around you. Be kind to others. Do not insult or put down other participants. Behave professionally. Remember that harassment and sexist, racist, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for the community.

When we disagree, we try to understand why. Disagreements, both social and technical, happen all the time and a Cyclic-compliant group is no exception. It is important that we resolve disagreements and differing views constructively. Remember that we're different. The strength of Cyclic-compliant group comes from its varied community, people from a wide range of backgrounds. Different people have different perspectives on issues. Being unable to understand why someone holds a viewpoint doesn't mean that they're wrong. Don't forget that it is human to err and blaming each other doesn't get us anywhere, rather offer to help resolving issues and to help learn from mistakes.

### Commitee

A Cyclic-compliant group should establish a staff or commitee that is responsible for enforcing the above code of conduct. The committee must agree on a resolution by consensus.

Possible responses may include:

- Taking no further action (if the committee determine no violation occurred).
- A private reprimand from the committee to the individual(s) involved.
- A public reprimand. In this case, a committee member will deliver that reprimand in the same venue that the violation occurred (i.e. in the same Discord channel for a Discord violation; in IRC for an IRC violation; email for an email violation, etc.). The committee may choose to publish this message elsewhere for posterity.
- An imposed vacation (i.e. asking someone to "take a week off" from the common area). A committee member will communicate this "vacation" to the individual(s). They'll be asked to take this vacation voluntarily, but if they don't agree then a temporary ban may be imposed to enforce this vacation.
- A permanent or temporary ban from some or all Cyclic group spaces (Discord server, common library, etc.). The committee will maintain records of all such bans so that they may be reviewed in the future, extended to new Cyclic group fora, or otherwise maintained.
- A request for a public or private apology. a committee member will deliver this request. The committee may, if it chooses, attach "strings" to this request: for example, the committee may ask a violator to apologize in order to retain his or her membership on the group.

Once a resolution is agreed upon, but before it is enacted, the committee will contact the original reporter and any other affected parties and explain the proposed resolution. The committee will ask if this resolution is acceptable, and must note feedback for the record. However, the committee is not required to act on this feedback.

### Conflicts of Interest

In the event of any conflict of interest a committee member must immediately notify the other members, and recuse themselves if necessary. If a report concerns a possible violation by a current committee member, this member should be excluded from the response process. For these cases, anyone can make a report directly to any of the committee members.

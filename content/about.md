# The Cyclic Story

Cyclic Support Group (CSG) is the first attempt in implementing a [Cyclic-compliant]() group. The group currently consists of Filipino individuals working on diffrent things including music, arts, photography, math, programming, etc.

### Conception

The initial idea of [Cyclic Framework]() was originally conceived by [Infinity Grass]() in March 21, 2019. Instead of attending an _Alternative Class Learning Experience_ (ACLE) happening back then, he decided to stay at home and binge-watch YouTube videos like a total wasteman. Thankfully, some good came into it as he was introduced to [Standard](https://standard.tv/).

The initial concept for Cyclic was heavily-inspired by [Standard]() &mdash; a support group of creative people helping each other toward their goals. The idea pretty much is solid, however, due to the amount of academic backlogs present then, the first implementation was delayed for nine months.

### Twists and Turns

The first iteration to this idea was implemented on December 2019 in the form of a [Habitica guild](https://habitica.com) named [Mga Poro Self-improvement Guild](https://habitica.com/groups/guild/6bd8732c-aee0-45da-ac3b-ce7155086f77). The approach back then was to introduce a different experience from a typical Habitica guild. Additional gamification elements ( gamified onboarding and level up features ) are implemented to extend Habitica's functionality. Although the growth of the guild is amazing ( 2-3 new members per week, organic ), within just three months of operation, some serious problems came up. For one, the moderation and maintenance of the guild can not keep up with the amount of new users coming in. Scalability stalled as the automation system to support the whole guild is still in early development during the time when users needed it most.

Additionally, the founder of the guild is not seeing the outcome that he expected. The gamification system is backfiring - users are more concerned about leveling up and ranking up. However, relying in external gratification is not a good habit to be trained for.

These challenges, together with the uncertainties brought by the COVID-19 pandemic, made the guild activities stop in March 2020. The guild was officially discontinued later in July, 2020.

### Cyclic Version 1

Although the guild didn't end up like what the founders wanted it to be, they did took note of what should and shouldn't be done in a self-improvement community. From that flaws, corrections were made that ultimately led for [Infinity Grass]() and [Isolated Echo]() to draft the [first version of the guidlines](https://sites.google.com/view/cyclic-group/guidelines) in June 29, 2020.

1. Accountability over rigid habits

   During the guild implementation, although members were consistently accomplishing the habitica tasks, they were doing it with no intrinsic goal in mind &mdash; being productive for productivity's sake. As such, the new draft disbanded the gamification system and any arbitrary course-like structure which wrongly-incentivized its group members.

   Also, during this time, the [#100DaysOfX](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23100DaysOfX) challenge
   is in its all time high. [Infinity Grass]() and [Isolated Echo]() were both participants in this challenge. They both experience first-hand how effective the challenge is. No habit trackers, no centralized authority, no external system to be followed, just a bunch of people doing what they want in an accountable manner &mdash; and it's both fun and effective! This activity becomes the basis of [Cyclic v1 core principle 1 & 2](https://sites.google.com/view/cyclic-group/guidelines#h.901g88x7ksq0).

2. Driving a car over launching a rocket

   The founders realized that the draft should be iterative in nature. This means that its definitions and structure should be flexible enough to pivot any time. Hence, the guidelines was made to be open-sourced in the future. It takes inspiration from open-source communities like the [World Wide Web Consortium](https://www.w3.org/).

3. Proper and throttled onboarding

   One flaw in the former habitica guild is the unregulated onboarding process. Membership is open and anyone can just hop in any time. Although this decreases the barrier of entry, it also makes the onboarding process hasty. Also, it severely makes moderation and maintenance difficult to handle. Hence, to have the most optimal value-per-member density, the draft explicitly states the [user invitations should be throttled](https://sites.google.com/view/cyclic-group/guidelines#h.5jbwg0fghkxp).

The next day, July 1, 2020, the guidelines was officially implemented using a Discord server &mdash; the Cyclic Support Group. [Inazumaron](), [Ivan Castor](), and [Charael Marfil]() were invited to join. Them, together with the persons responsible for drafting the guidelines, [Infinity Grass]() and [Isolated Echo](), became the founding members of Cyclic.

"Cyclic" was named after a chemical ring compound from a quick Google search for "two-syllable words".

### Cyclic Version 2

After 14 months of operation, Cyclic Support Group is still functioning and is steadily increasing its members. Although there are phases where users became busy with their semester, nothing catastrophic has happened and the community is still functioning as intended. This is an indication that the group is going in the right direction.

In May 24, 2021, the first draft for Cyclic Version 2.0 has been created. The Cyclic 2.0 highlights few major revisions:

- Requiring regular standups
- Introducing activity states (i.e. vacation mode)
- Formalizing the Cyclic framework

The migration to version 2 started in May 29, 2021.
Cyclic 2.0 will be published on August 4. Cyclic 1.0 will be officially deprecated on August 11, 2021.

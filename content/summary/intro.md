# What is Cyclic?

Cyclic is a place where members are free to express their creativity in any shape or form.

> Welcome to Cyclic, where we attempt to improve ourselves and help encourage others effort for said improvement. Whether you like to draw, craft, code, create, or honestly anything, feel free to share them here, especially with things you'd like to improve on.
